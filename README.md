This project was built as part of the course “Advanced NLP with Python for Machine Learning”

# 📌 Sentiment Analysis with SpaCy & DistilBERT  

## 🔎 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates **sentiment analysis on unstructured text data** using both classical NLP (SpaCy) and modern deep learning (HuggingFace Transformers with DistilBERT).  

The workflow includes:  
- Text preprocessing and tokenization with **SpaCy**  
- Sentiment classification with **DistilBERT**  
- Data visualization of sentiment distribution with **pie and bar charts**

## 🔗 Connection to Previous Work  
This project builds on my learnings from the course **“Hands-On AI: Building Your First Conversational AI Chatbot.”**  

- In the chatbot course, I learned the **fundamentals of conversational AI** on how chatbots parse input and generate meaningful responses.  
- In this project, I expanded into **sentiment analysis**, giving AI the ability to understand not just *what* users say, but also *how they feel*.  
- Combined, these skills open the door to **next-generation conversational AI systems** that can respond **empathetically** with adaptively tone, and provide businesses with **real-time insights into customer emotions**.

## ⚙️ Tech Tools 
- **Python**  
- **SpaCy** for NLP preprocessing  
- **HuggingFace Transformers** using the DistilBERT model
- **Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib** libraries for data handling & visualization

👉 This repository showcases how I’m **progressively building AI skills** from **conversational AI foundations** to **emotionally intelligent NLP systems**.
